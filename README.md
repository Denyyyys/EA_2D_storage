## General Info

This project uses an evolutionary algorithm to optimize the placement of rectangular items within a store layout, aiming to maximize space efficiency while respecting placement constraints.

## Structure

- The core logic of the evolutionary algorithm is located in the main_app folder.

- The client_app folder contains a React-based user interface for creating items of various shapes and configuring store dimensions.
